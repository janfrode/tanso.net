On 15 May the 6-man G4 Expedition (Norway) flew in to the glacier below
Gunnbjørnsfjeld and from there made ascents of Gunnbjørnsfjeld, Dome and Cone.
Per Ove Oppedal and Torstein Skage carried skis to all three summits and made
the first ski descents of Gunnbjørnsfjeld and Dome. They also made the second
ski descent of Cone, having been beaten to the first descent by a team of
their countrymen from Tromsø who were just one day ahead of them. In a long
day from their base camp the team then climbed a twin-horned peak they
referred to as Styggehorn (3503m) overlooking the Christian IV glacier which
they believed to be the highest unclimbed mountain in Greenland. They then
moved to the east to the Bergen gletscher area and set up a new base from
where they made claimed first ascents of peaks named as Anita Fjeld (2466m),
Ebeth (2628m), Snefjeld (2650m) and Istind (2667m) with ski descents of the
first two. In the early part of the trip they experienced temperatures of
-10°C to -30°C, but towards the end of May it warmed to -5°C - +5°C.
