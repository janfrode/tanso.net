	<h1>The 2004 expedition - G4 - Bergen Fjellsport to Watkins Bjerge</h1>

	<i>Please click on the markers in the above map, to read details about each mountain.</i>
	<p />
	In May 2004 I was on an expedition to the Watkins Mountains on Greenland, with the 
	aim to climb the 3 highest mountains on Greenland (Mt. Gunnbjorn, Dome, Cone). The 
	expedition was a major success, and we managed to climb a total of 19 summits, 
	including what we believe was 10 first ascents! Two of the team members also skied
	on Telemark down the 3 highest summits, another first achievement.
	<p />
	The expedition members were me (Jan-Frode Myklebust), Arnt Flatmo, Torstein Skage, 
	Per Ove Oppedal, Ståle Grimen and expedition leader Petter Bjørstad.
	<p />
	Most memorable summits for me was "Snefjeld" (which was quite exposed) and "Istind" which 
	was the only roped climb I did. "Istind" looked quite scary from below, and we had to have
	2 tries to get to the top. Plus of course the hat-trick of Cone,  Dome and Hvitserk which
	to me was mostly hard work, but still a great way of celebrating May 17th!
	<p />
	A detailed report with lots of great pictures can be read at Arnt Flatmo's
