j2me-otp: The Java OTP Calculator for cell phones.
==================================================
Jan-Frode Myklebust <janfrode@tanso.net>



Here's a port of http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/harry/jotp/[jotp] to 
Java 2 Platform Micro Edition (J2ME), so that it can be used on 
mobile phones that supports Java. I made this so that I can securely 
connect to our ssh-server from insecure internet cafees, where 
people might be trying to sniff my passsword. The midlet supports 
md5-hashing, since that's what I'm using. Adding md4 should be 
trivial, if anybody needs it.

I use this with an openssh server configured with '--with-skey',
to securely log into my servers from unsecure terminals.


Source and binaries
-------------------

* Browse the source and history at http://github.com/janfrode/j2me-otp[github]
* Clone the source tree from git://github.com/janfrode/j2me-otp.git
* http://tanso.net/j2me-otp/jotp.jad[jotp.jad] Open this URL in your cell phone to install the application.
* http://tanso.net/j2me-otp/jotp.jar[jotp.jar] (obfuscated to save memory)


Building and testing in emulator
--------------------------------

You will need the 
http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/overview.html[Sun Java Wireless Toolkit for CLDC]
to build it from source. The Sun Java Wireless Toolkit also includes an
emulator, so that it's easy to test the application without uploading it
to the phone. Very handy for development. To test it in the emulator, 
download the .jad and .jar and execute: 'emulator -Xdescriptor:jotp.jad'.

Tested phones
-------------

When I developed this, I had a Nokia 6310, which (un)fortunately didn't
manage to run j2me-otp because of lack of memory. It only had 128KB static and
50KB dynamic memory. So I had an excuse to buy a new phone, a Nokia 7310
series 60 phone, where it worked well. A few other phones reported to work:

* Sony Ericsson Z520i
* Sony Ericsson K800i
* Sony Ericsson W810i
* Sony Ericsson W880i
* Sony Ericsson T610
* Siemens SX1
* Siemens SK65
* Nokia 7310
* Nokia 6820
* Nokia 6600
* Nokia 6230i
* Nokia 6021
* Nokia 3650
* Nokia 3410
* Nokia E61
* Nokia E65 (my new smartphone :-)
* Nokia Communicator 9300, 9300i and 9500
* Motorola Razor v3i

But I suspect any modern phone with java support should handle it.
