Installing rsyslog under Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
===================================================

Rsyslog, the enhanced syslogd for Linux and Unix
------------------------------------------------

rsyslogd has been scheduled to replace sysklogd in
fedora 8, and I assume it will also be used in RHEL6. 
Unfortunately RHEL6 is still far away, and it would be
good to get started with a better syslog ASAP on RHEL5.

Building
--------

I pulled down the latest SRPM from
http://people.redhat.com/pvrabec/rpms/rsyslog/[] installed it (as non-root).
Since this SRPM is lagging a bit behind the fast paced rsyslog-development, 
I downloaded the latest rsyslog release, updated the version number
in the rsyslog.spec-file, and built it. The source and binary is available http://tanso.net/yum/repodata/repoview/R.group.html[here].

--------
% rpm -ba rsyslog.spec
--------

And then install it as root with:

--------
# rpm -Uvh ~janfrode/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/rsyslog-1.18.2-1.i386.rpm
--------

SElinux
-------

When I launch my newly installed rsyslogd from the initscript, everything
seemingly works, and no new AVC's are logged to the audit log. Strange. So
I suspect it might be running as an unconfined process:

---------------------
# ps -efZ|grep syslog
root:system_r:initrc_t          root     27263     1  0 12:22 ?  00:00:00 rsyslogd -m 0 -r
---------------------

Good guess, but not completely right. It's running in "initrc_t", 
so it hasn't transitioned to the right domain "syslogd_t". And the
cause is of course that the binary isn't labeled correctly:

----------------------
# ls -Z /sbin/rsyslogd
-rwxr-xr-x  root root system_u:object_r:sbin_t         /sbin/rsyslogd
# chcon -t syslogd_exec_t /sbin/rsyslogd
# ls -Z /sbin/rsyslogd
-rwxr-xr-x  root root system_u:object_r:syslogd_exec_t /sbin/rsyslogd
----------------------

That looks better, and when I restart it, it transitiones to the right domain:

----------------------
# /etc/init.d/rsyslog stop
Shutting down kernel logger (rklogd):                      [  OK  ]
Shutting down system logger (rsyslog):                     [  OK  ]
# /etc/init.d/rsyslog start
Starting system logger (rsyslog):                          [  OK  ]
Starting kernel logger (rklogd):                           [  OK  ]
# ps -eZ|grep rsyslog
root:system_r:syslogd_t         31498 ?        00:00:00 rsyslogd
----------------------

Finally, to make sure I don't loose the label on /sbin/rsyslogd, 
I add a local labeling rule for it and verify that it works as
expected:

----------------------
# semanage fcontext -a -t syslogd_exec_t /sbin/rsyslogd
# restorecon /sbin/rsyslogd
# ls -Z /sbin/rsyslogd
-rwxr-xr-x  root root system_u:object_r:syslogd_exec_t /sbin/rsyslogd
----------------------

Ooops, there's also a rklogd process that needs to be moved to the
right domain:

----------------------
# ps -eZ|grep klogd
root:system_r:initrc_t          31506 ?        00:00:00 rklogd
# ls -Z /sbin/rklogd 
-rwxr-xr-x  root root system_u:object_r:sbin_t         /sbin/rklogd
# semanage fcontext -a -t klogd_exec_t /sbin/rklogd 
# restorecon /sbin/rklogd
# /etc/init.d/rsyslog restart
Shutting down kernel logger (rklogd):                      [  OK  ]
Shutting down system logger (rsyslog):                     [  OK  ]
Starting system logger (rsyslog):                          [  OK  ]
Starting kernel logger (rklogd):                           [  OK  ]
# ps -eZ|grep klogd
root:system_r:klogd_t           31981 ?        00:00:00 rklogd
----------------------

There's also a "RFC 3195 listener" installed as "/sbin/rfc3195d". I'm not
currently using this, so i haven't fixed it's label. But I suspect it should
be labeled the same as "/sbin/rsyslogd".

Configuration
-------------

By default rsyslogd is configured to do the same simple logging as sysklogd,
using an identical configuration file. That works, but then what's the
point of rsyslogd :-)

* We want a directory structure with daily complete logfiles per host:
--------------
$template DailyPerHostLogs,"/var/log/rsyslog/%$YEAR%/%$MONTH%/%$DAY%/%HOSTNAME%.log"
*.* -?DailyPerHostLogs
--------------

* We want to collect all mail logs from different hosts, to the same file.  Rotated hourly:
--------------
$template HourlyMaillog,"/var/log/rsyslog/maillog/%$YEAR%/%$MONTH%/%$DAY%/maillog-%$YEAR%-%$MONTH%-%$DAY%-%$HOUR%.log"
mail.* -?HourlyMaillog
--------------

* We want the logs from one specific application to be captured to one log file:
--------------
:programname, isequal, "sendmail"  -/var/log/rsyslog/sendmail.log
:programname, isequal, "kernel"  -/var/log/rsyslog/kernel.log
--------------

or rather dynamically without knowing every app-name up front:
--------------
$template PerAppLogs,"/var/log/rsyslog/apps/%programname%.log"
*.* -?PerAppLogs
--------------


Todo:
-----

* Explore rsyslog configuration.

* Collect same service from multiple hosts into the same log file.

* Test http://wiki.rsyslog.com/index.php/FailoverSyslogServer[failover logging].

* Logg to database ?
